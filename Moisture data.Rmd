## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dbplyr)

```

```{r}
soil.moisture <- read_csv(here("data", "Neighbor seedling soil moisture total.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  rename("treatment" = "drought_or_control") %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>%
  mutate(group = paste(treatment,date,sep = ""))

ggplot(soil.moisture, aes(x = date, y = moisture, fill = treatment, group = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
    labs(
    y= "Percent Moisture",
    x="Date") +
  theme_minimal()+
    scale_fill_manual(values= c("cadetblue3", "goldenrod3"), name= "Treatment", labels= c("Control", "Droughted")) +
  facet_wrap(~treatment)

ggplot(soil.moisture, aes(x = date, y = moisture, fill = treatment, group = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
    labs(
    y= "Percent Moisture",
    x="Date") +
  theme_minimal()+
    scale_fill_manual(values= c("cadetblue3", "goldenrod3"), name= "Treatment", labels= c("Control", "Droughted"))
